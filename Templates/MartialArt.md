## **Martial Artist**
You're not some common, cheap for hire thug. You're an Artist of the Weapon Human. Any idiot can throw a punch, but it takes dedication to the art to truly hone your skills. 

You gain +1 HP for every Martial Artist Template taken.

Starting Equipment: a towel, 2 rations
Starting Skills: 1) First Aid, 2) Athletics, 3) 

A. Fighting Styles and Moves <br>
B. +2 Moves <br>
C. +2 Moves <br>
D. +2 Moves <br>

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fighting Styles and Moves</span>**

You're a fightman from fightland. Through training you've learned a fighting type and a couple of moves from the school. Select a school (listed below) and gain access to that list of Moves. You start with the ability to learn (from a teacher or manual) the first 6 Moves, and gain access to the rest of the list the more you master your school (take templates), as listed here:

Template A - First 6 Moves <br>
Template B - First 8 Moves <br>
Template C - First 10 Moves <br>
Template D - All 12 Moves <br>

If the Template A is your First Template, you begin with two Moves. 

Every Template taken after A, gain 2 additional Moves for free, chosen by roll.

Each move has an associated cost per level, which is paid in Inventory slots. A 3 point move at a level 2 costs 6 Inventory spaces (3x2=6), a 2 point move at level 4 takes up 8 Inventory space (2x4=8), a 5 point move at level 3 takes up 15 Inventory spaces (5x3=15), and so on. Switching out moves to/from your inventory is a simple matter of performing a routine of exercises in the early morning. Much like the wizard nerds prep their spells.<br>

Moves are found in the list for the Style they belong to. 

### **Training** <br>
Learning a new move is done in one of two ways: <br>
<ui>
<li><b>Trainer:</b> Find someone who already knows the move you're looking for and have them teach it to you. After a week, you know it. Pricey.</li> <br>
<li><b>Manuel:</b> Find a book detailing the move you want to learn and spend a week reading practicing. After that time, make an Int check to learn the move. Failure means you failed to learn and need to spend more time practicing. Cheaper, but not guaranteed. </li><br>
